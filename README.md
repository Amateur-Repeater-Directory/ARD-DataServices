# ARD-DataServices
The .NET REST API for accessing the repeater data programatically. The DBMS System used to host the data will be Microsoft SQL Server. We will also publish the Database Schema for the Repeater data here. There will be a tool (console app0 that you can use to load the Repeater Data JSON located in the *ARD-RepeaterList* repository into a local copy of SQL Server on your machine. This tool will be located in the *ARD-Tools* repository. So you'll be off and writing your application in no time. 

Of course, we hope contributers will share SQL scripts for other DBMS systems such as MySQL, Oracle, Postgres and others as we imagine this data will be used to create a lot of fantastic tools. It's time for Innovation !!
